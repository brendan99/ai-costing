In the UK, a legal cost draftsman (also known as a costs lawyer) is a specialist in legal costs. Their primary role is to manage, analyse, and negotiate the costs incurred during legal proceedings. They ensure that these costs are fair, reasonable, proportionate, and compliant with legal standards and regulations. This benefits both the clients and the legal practitioners involved.

Legal cost draftsmen are crucial for the financial efficiency of the legal process. Many solicitors lack the specific knowledge, experience, or time to prepare their own detailed bills of costs and navigate the complexities of cost recovery. Cost draftsmen assist solicitors in maximizing the legal costs they can recover and provide expert advice and guidance throughout the process. Their expertise is required throughout a claim, not just at the end.

Key responsibilities of a legal cost draftsman include:

Preparing Bills of Costs: This involves drafting detailed, itemised accounts of all legal costs incurred by a party during litigation. These bills must meticulously calculate and present all recoverable work done, time spent by legal professionals, hourly rates, and disbursements (such as court fees, counsel's fees, and expert witness fees).

Drafting Schedules of Costs: These are less comprehensive summaries of costs, often required for interim hearings or summary assessments.

Preparing Costs Budgets (Precedent H): This involves forecasting future legal costs in a case, a crucial part of modern litigation. They also assist in negotiating these budgets with the opposing party (using Precedent R).

Advising on Retainers and Fee Arrangements: They can help prepare compliant Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs) and ensure appropriate calculation of success fees and hourly rates.

Negotiating Costs: They often represent clients in costs-related negotiations, mediations, or hearings to reach agreements on the amount of costs to be paid.

Dealing with Points of Dispute and Replies: When costs are contested, the paying party will serve "Points of Dispute" outlining their objections to the Bill of Costs. The receiving party's cost draftsman will then draft "Replies to Points of Dispute" to counter these arguments and justify the costs claimed.

Assisting with Detailed Assessment Hearings: If costs cannot be agreed upon, the matter proceeds to a detailed assessment hearing where a judge will scrutinise the Bill of Costs and Points of Dispute/Replies. Cost draftsmen may represent clients at these hearings.

Advising on Regulatory Compliance: They provide guidance on legal fee structures and cost management, ensuring adherence to relevant rules and practice directions.

Handling Legal Aid Costs: This includes preparing claims for costs for legally aided cases, sometimes involving High Costs Case Plans.

Input Files and Documents Consumed by a Legal Cost Draftsman:

To perform their role, legal cost draftsmen consume a variety of documents generated throughout the legal case. These primarily include:

The Solicitor's File of Papers: This is the primary source of information and will contain:

Attendance notes

Correspondence (letters, emails)

Court documents (claim forms, defences, orders, witness statements, expert reports)

Counsel's fee notes and other disbursement vouchers

Time records or ledgers detailing work done by fee earners

Client care letters and Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs)

Any existing costs budgets or estimates

Court Orders: Particularly orders relating to costs.

Expert Reports and Invoices.

Counsel's Fee Notes and Briefs.

Disbursement Vouchers: Proof of expenses paid out by the solicitor on behalf of the client.

Output Files and Documents Produced by a Legal Cost Draftsman:

The primary outputs of a legal cost draftsman are formal documents required for the costs assessment and recovery process. These include:

Bill of Costs: A detailed, itemised statement of a party's legal costs. This is often prepared in a specific format, such as Precedent S or an electronic bill. It includes a chronological history of key stages, a narrative of the dispute, a breakdown of costs by litigation stage, hourly rates, time spent, and disbursements.

Schedules of Costs: Condensed versions of total fees for specific purposes.

Costs Budgets (Precedent H): Detailed forecasts of future costs.

Budget Discussion Reports (Precedent R): Documents used for negotiating costs budgets.

Statements of Costs for Trial (Form N260): A summary of costs for summary assessment by the court, often at the conclusion of a hearing or trial.

Points of Dispute: If acting for the paying party, the draftsman will prepare these documents to formally challenge items in the receiving party's Bill of Costs. These must be short, to the point, and follow the Precedent G format.

Replies to Points of Dispute: If acting for the receiving party, these are drafted to respond to the paying party's objections and justify the costs claimed. These should also follow the Precedent G format and be limited to points of principle and concessions.

Notices of Commencement (Form N252): This form initiates the detailed assessment process.

Advice on Offers and Settlements related to costs.

Instructions to Counsel for detailed assessment hearings.

Applications for Default Costs Certificates (if the paying party fails to serve Points of Dispute in time).

The work of a legal cost draftsman is highly specialised and integral to the litigation process in the UK, ensuring fairness and accuracy in the often complex area of legal costs.
